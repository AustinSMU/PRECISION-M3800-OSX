OS X Yosemite on Dell Precision M3800
====================================

This repository contains documentation and research on the installation of OS X Yosemite (10.10) on the [Dell Precision M3800](http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/precision-m3800-workstation/pd) 

This documentation is for the QHD+ 3200x1800 i7-4702/4712 model. There are sill many graphics issues with the slightly higher resolution 4K displays. This process is **very** specific, and must be followed with rigourous detail. The smallest deviation from my exact instructions could prevent a successful final system. Read through the entire guide before beginning, there are many housekeeping steps that much be done in advance, and be especially careful when patching your BIOS - incorrectly performing these steps can BRICK YOUR DEVICE. I am not responsible for any damage incurred as a result of misappropriately applying these steps.
